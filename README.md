## Disclaimer
**I am not an encryption or cybersecurity expert.**  I am a programmer that enjoys learning new things, and then I share those things with the community.  I cannot, at this time, 100% guarantee the encryption strength of the messages generated by this application, so **use at your own risk**. 

## Current Version: 0.1.2
- Encrypts and decrypts any file
- Manages Encryption Keys

## Instructions
- Run ```python application.py``` and the GUI app should load.
